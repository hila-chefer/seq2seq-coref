In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media . With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention . The world 's fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here . The most important thing about Disney is that it is a global brand . Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect . Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland . The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 . In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years . One . Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong . As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone . Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention . There 's only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 . The subway to Disney has already been constructed . At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens . Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park . For two years , Disney has constantly maintained its mystery . No media have been allowed to enter for photos . We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by . However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney . On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions . Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , no cars can enter unless they have special permission . No one can enter otherwise . Video recording is especially forbidden . Ah , everything is top secret . If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle . Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .
